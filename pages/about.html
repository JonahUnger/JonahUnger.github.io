	<p>I am a 20 year old student, attending a Bachelor's program in Game Production and Design at Abertay University, in Dundee Scotland. I will be focusing on the writing and creative aspects of video game design. I was homeschooled from 3rd to 12th grade, and have been attending Harrisburg Area Community College (<a href="https://www.hacc.edu/">HACC</a>) since my junior year of high school; I graduated from HACC with an Associates in Applied science in May of 2021.</p>
	<p>Over the past few years at HACC, I have developed extensive experience in most areas of web design, including knowledge of numerous coding languages, experience with image editing in many different formats, 2-D and stop-motion animation, graphic design, and other aspects of both web and interactive media. A full list of my qualifications can be seen in my <a href="resume.html">resume.</a> My most recent project is a website for a local orchard, which I worked on along with two of my peers, and can be seen <a href="works.html">here.</a></p>
	<p>Although until now my college career has been spent studying the various aspects of web design (including coding, graphic design, photo editing, and typography), my true passion and future career are in video game design. I have always had a deep passion for creative writing, especially the process of world-building. To further this career, I will be studying at Abertay University, a college with an excellent reputation in the field of game design. I look forward to living in Scotland over the next four years, and am excited to see how I can use this oportunity to grow and learn.</p></div>
