                        I am a 23 year old student, currently in my 4th year of a Bachelor's program in <a href="https://www.abertay.ac.uk/course-search/undergraduate/computer-game-applications-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Production and Design</a> at <a href="https://www.abertay.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abertay University</a> in Dundee Scotland. I was homeschooled from 3rd to 12th grade, and attended Harrisburg Area Community College (<a href="https://www.hacc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HACC</a>) since my junior year of high school; I graduated from HACC with an Associates in Applied science in May of 2019.
                        <br />Over my time at HACC, I developed extensive experience in most areas of web design including knowledge of numerous coding languages, experience with image editing in many different formats, 2-D and stop-motion animation, graphic design, and other aspects of both web and interactive media. My most final project for this degree was website for a local orchard, which I worked on along with two of my peers, and can be seen <a href="http://sunhighorchard.farm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently in my 4th year at Abertay University, in Dundee, Scotland, where I am pursuing a Bachelor's of Honours in Game Design and Production. During my time, I have worked on a number of individual and group projects, the highlights of which can be seen in my <a href="works.html">Selected Works.</a>
                        <br />I have also been employed at <a href="https://www.yaldigames.com">Yaldi Games</a> for about a year, where I was initially brought on as an intern. I have spent the last few months working as their Narrative and Game Designer, where my duties have mainly consisted of quest design, narrative planning, documentation, creating backstory and worldbuilding, and extensive testing.
                        <br />I have experience in multiple game engines, mainly Unity and Unreal, am capable with the entire Adobe and Microsoft Office suites, and have some knowledge of 3D and 2D game art pipelines. While I am capable in programming and art, my expertise and passion lie with design.
                        <br />A full list of my qualifications can be seen in my <a href="resume.html">resume.</a>

                    <h5>Hobbies</h5>
                    <p>While my education and passion are both concerned with design, I have a past rich with different experiences. Some of my greatest strengths, such as public speaking, come from my long envolvement in local theatre. Since Autumn of 2012 I have been in roughly 60 shows, both on and behind stage. More recently, I have served on the committee of the<a href="https://www.abertaysa.com/groups/sal-drama" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAL Drama Society</a>, as the P.R. Representative (2022/23), and as President (2023/24, 2024/25).</p>
                    <p>Creative writing has always been another one of my passions, and I have found a wonderful way to practice my creative skills is through role-play games, such as Dungeons and Dragons. I have been a fan of D&#38;D for years, but only recently started to seriously play. I greatly enjoy the process of character creation and world-building in a responsive and adaptive environment, and firmly believe that games such as D&#38;D, when taken seriously, can strengthen creative talents and improve teamwork skills.</p>
