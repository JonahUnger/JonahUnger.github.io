                    <p>Created for DES313 (Player Experience Design), at Abertay University, 2023-24. This game consists of a short walking-sim style experience, with a heavy focus on environmental storytelling. The assignment was to analyse three games and create a game with similar themes or mechanics.

                    <p>Narrative Design - Visual Novel</p>
                    <p>Created for DES311 (Game Design Practice), at Abertay University, 2023-24. This module allowed me to focus on a personal project and develop skills specific to my desired career. As such, in order to explore narrative design and character writing, I chose to create a visual novel based around characters and narratives from the game I was working on as part of my job.
                    <br />I chose to use this project as a way of exploring the characters and stories I was working on in my professional life, and as a way to gain better understanding of these characters.

                        Created for DES310 (Professional Project), at Abertay University, 2023-24. This game was created by an interdisciplinary group of 8 students, based on a brief given by an industry client. The brief given to our team, "Cubic Burrito," was <em>Hands Off</em>.
                        <br />With this brief, our team created a VR team with a focus on goofy interactions and silly physics.

                    <p>3D Modelling Project: War Scythe</p>
                    <p>This project was completed for DES204 (3D Modelling), at Abertay University 2022-23. This assignment tasked me with creating a 3D asset, along with all required materials and textures. For this assignement I used Maya 2023, Adobe Substance Painter, Adobe Substance Designer, and Unreal Engine 5. This screenshot is of the final scene rendered in Unreal Engine 5.
