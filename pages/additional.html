      <div class="col-6 hobbies"><h5>Hobbies</h5><p>While my education has been in web design and my career is in game design, I have a past rich with different experiences. Some of my greatest strengths, such as public speaking, come from my long envolvement in local theatre. Since Fall of 2012 I have been an avid thespian, enjoying being onstage, backstage, or watching from the audience.</p>
		<p>Creative writing has always been another one of my passions, and a wonderful way to strengthen your creative skills is through role-play games, such as Dungeons and Dragons. I have been a large fan of D&D for years, but only recently started to seriously play. I greatly enjoy the process of character creation and world-building in a responsive and adaptive environment, and firmly believe that games such as D&D, when taken seriously, can strengthen creative talents and improve teamwork skills.</p></div>
		
      <div class="col-6"><h5>Groups</h5><p>I am a member of the Phi Thetta Kappa Honors Society, Alpha Nu Omega chapter. In 2020, I participated in two group projects: the Honors in Action was focused on researching the effects of community gardens on mental health, physical health, and the environment, and then attempting to start or fund a community garden in or near HACC; and the College Project was tasked with creating an online way for students to interact with and support one another, helping to fill the gaps left by Covid-induced social distancing.</p>
